# Objects and Classes

## What is an Object.
An object you can think of as a container that has two main parts.

### Data -> State -> Attribute (default)
<hr />
Data are the things that describe the well attributes of any thing.
Let's take a car attribute for example.

 - Brand -> Opel
 - Sub brand -> Astra
 - Color -> Black
 - Transmission -> Manual
 
 Those are all attributes or state of the car.
 In Python, how you would access those attributes are normally with a dot notation.
 Example:

    car.brand -> "Opel"
    car.sub_brand -> "Astra"
    car.color -> "
    car.transmission

###  Functionality -> Behavior -> Methods (default)
